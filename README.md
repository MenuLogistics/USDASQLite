# USDASQLite
SQLite Version Food Data Central (also known as USDA ) 

#Objective :

USDA provides the database in MS-Access format as well as Excel / CSV format, sometimes for internal applications , the developer needs to host / access the data from their device (like android , ios, desktop etc.,) context, in such situations they can use the SQLite format available for this project. Remember its a 430MB file, use it only if your mobile application demands a offline version of USDA data, else you can always use the REST API 

#REST API Access:

The FoodData Central API provides REST access to FoodData Central (FDC). It is intended primarily to assist application developers wishing to incorporate nutrient data into their applications or websites. For more details visit https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html

#Licensing:

You can use the data as per your need without any licensing needs. Please refer the terms (as per USDA )
